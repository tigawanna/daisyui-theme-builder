# Daisyui theme builder

inspired by [daisy ui theme builder](https://themes.ionevolve.com/) but all the state is stored in the URL making it

- sharable and revisatbale from history
- messed up? just hit the browser's back button
- start from the default daisyui themes , lock a specific value and switch the daisyui theme which will change every other value but the locked value to the new theme
- lock specific colors so that they don't change when you switch themes
